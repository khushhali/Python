#list:-
            list is an orderd collection of elements .It is a mutable object ie;
            it is possible to add new object or dlt any object from it. -
           Ex:- [1,2,3,4,5,6]
            *  it is created by placing elements in[]and seperated
               by commas.
            *  indexing is define for each value that is prsnt in
               list.

#tuple:-
         tuple is an orderd collection of elements. it is a immutable object ie;
         it is not possible to change the elements of the tuple.
      Ex:-(1,2,3,4,5,6)
      *  it is created by placing elements in() and seperated by commas.
      * indexing is define for each value that is prsnt in tuple.

#set:-
      set is an unorderd collection of entities.it contains unique values or
      entities.
    ----- there is no indexing in set.
    * in general set should be immutrable objest but it is an mutable object.
    ## in set we can't give a name to the elements as a list but can give
    name to the elements of the set as a tuple and set.
    Ex:- {int,float ,tuple, string}

#Dictionary:-
               dict is an unordered collection of elements in python where data
               is stored in key: value pairs.
        Ex:-{a:2,b:3,c:4,d:5}
       *  key should be mutable but value can be mutable or immutable both.
        # dict is mutable object itself.
